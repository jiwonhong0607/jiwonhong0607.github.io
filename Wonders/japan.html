Aogashima is a tiny island in the Philippine Sea, more than 350km south of Tokyo.<br/>
Despite being incredibly isolated and just 3.5km long by 2.5km wide, some 206 brave people call it home.<br/>
The Island itself is a volcano and the last eruption in 1785 killed 140 people (almost half the population at the time).<br/>
Aogashima may have been calm since then, but it is still active, and itâ€™s only a matter of time till it once again flaunts its ferocious temper.<br/>
