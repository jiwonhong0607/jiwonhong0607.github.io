Aogashima – a tiny island in the Philippine Sea, more than 350km south of Tokyo.
Despite being incredibly isolated and just 3.5km long by 2.5km wide, some 206 brave people call it home.
 The last eruption in 1785 killed 140 people – almost half the population at the time.
  Aogashima may have been quiescent since then, but it is still active, and it’s only a matter of time till it once again flaunts its ferocious temper.
