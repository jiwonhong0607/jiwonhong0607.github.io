Milford Sound is located in New Zealand and are mountains formed by glaciers by the Ocean.<br/>
The length of Milford Sound is approximately 16km (9.94 miles) from the head of the fiord to the open sea<br/>
 At the pinnacle of Milford Sound is iconic Mitre Peak â€“ standing a proud 1,692 metres above sea level, it is certainly an impressive sight to behold.<br/>
The water is 265 metres deep, most of the sound's water is salty but some regions have been known to be brakkish/ fresh. <br/>
Milford Sound was carved by glaciers during the ice ages.
