Mount Everest is located on the border of Nepal and Tibet.<br/>
 Mount Everest is part of the Himalayas, the 1500-mile–long (2414-kilometer–long) mountain system that was formed when the Indo-Australian plate crashed into the Eurasian plate.<br/>
  The Himalayas rose in response to the subduction of the Indo-Australian plate under the Eurasian plate.<br/>
The Himalayan mountains continue to rise a few centimeters each year as the Indo-Australian plate continues moving northward into and under the Eurasian plate.<br/>
